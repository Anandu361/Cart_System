# Cart Management System
A Simple web application I built using Spring Boot. Here, users can log in, add products to the list, view the complete list of products, and download the complete list in PDF format or mail it to our email id.
The main reason I built this is to practice more about Spring Boot. And to be honest, it did help me a lot. Obviously, I needed help from ChatGPT for this, but I hope if I continue to practice on this, 
I can build more projects on my own.
