# Cart Management System
A Simple web application I built using Spring Boot. Here, users can log in, add products to the list, view the complete list, and download the full list in PDF format or email it to our email address.
The main reason I built this is to practice more with Spring Boot. And to be honest, it did help me a lot. Obviously, I needed help from ChatGPT for this, but I hope that if I continue to practice on this, 
I can build more projects on my own.
